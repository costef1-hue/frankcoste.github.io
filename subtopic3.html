        The FDA page explains how 3-D printing is used to produce a wide range of medical devices, from surgical guides and custom implants to dental restorations and prosthetics. It highlights the regulatory considerations and the agency's role in ensuring safety and effectiveness for patient-matched devices. The content makes clear that while additive manufacturing enables highly customized solutions based on patient imaging data, it also raises questions about material properties, process control, and validation that regulators must address. The page is useful for understanding both the practical medical uses and the safety framework surrounding printed medical devices.

        This Nature review summarizes modern bioprinting strategies and the state of bioinks, scaffolds, and printing technologies used for tissue engineering. It covers extrusion-based and projection-based techniques, explains current successes such as skin and cartilage constructs, and discusses the major hurdles for clinical application. The review is technical but helps readers appreciate how 3-D printing is moving beyond inert implants toward living constructs that include cells and biologically active materials. It also highlights challenges in reproducibility, vascularization, and long-term function that researchers are actively trying to solve.
