        This 3D Systems page traces the company origins and highlights the invention of stereolithography by Charles (Chuck) Hull in the early 1980s. It explains how Hull commercialized the SLA process and launched the first SLA machines, which made it possible to convert digital designs into physical parts. The timeline shows the growth from early research and expensive industrial systems to wider adoption as new methods and companies expanded the field. Reading this page gives a clear picture of how a single invention led to an entire industry and how the technology slowly moved from specialist labs toward broader industrial and educational use.

        This Formlabs article describes the origins and evolution of stereolithography and other early technologies, placing Hull's work alongside other inventors and subsequent milestones. It explains how different methods such as FDM and SLS emerged, expanding the number of printable materials and applications. The article emphasizes key turning points, including the invention of common file formats and the later arrival of cheaper desktop machines that opened 3-D printing to hobbyists and small businesses. It is a concise, readable summary that helps users understand the steps that took 3-D printing from niche prototypes to a widely used production and education tool.
